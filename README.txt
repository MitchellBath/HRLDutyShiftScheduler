INSTRUCTIONS:
Determine shifts needed and place them in the Dates column of the spreadsheet. Include both South Village and North East shifts, and place same-date shifts one after the other
Example: 1/1/24 SV, 1/1/24 NE, 1/2/24 SV, 1/2/24 NE etc.
Ask each employee to complete the shift preference spreadsheet by inputting a value for each date.
Ensure that the Feature Scaling column normalizes the preferences between 0 and 1 values
Place the ProstaffDutyScheduling.py script in a folder
Export each employee's spreadsheet sheet with full preferences as a .CSV file (comma separated values)
Place each employee's exported .CSV file into the same folder as ProstaffDutyScheduling.py
Ensure Python version 3.7.9 or higher is installed on the Windows machine
Run/execute/double click the ProstaffDutyScheduling.py file in the folder
As prompted, input each name of the .CSV files one after the other EXCLUDING the file extension and press <ENTER> after each entry
Example: MitchBath.csv should be inputted as MitchBath<ENTER>
